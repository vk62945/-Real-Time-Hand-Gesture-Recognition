# ✋-Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition

This project detects hand gestures in real time using **MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV**.  
It has three parts:  
1. Record Data – capture hand movements and save them as CSV.  
2. Train Model – train a neural network to learn gestures.  
3. Recognize Gestures** – use webcam to predict gestures live.

# How to Run
1. Run `record_gesture_data.py` to record gestures.  
2. Run `train_gesture_model.py` to train the model.  
3. Run `gesture_recognition.py` to test gestures in real time.  

# Requirements
- Python 3.10 for mac  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- TensorFlow  

# Future
- Add more gestures  
- Improve accuracy with better models  
- Deploy on mobile or edge devices
